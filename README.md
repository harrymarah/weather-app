# Weather App

## What is it?

- It's a simple react app that gives you the current weather forecast for any
  location

## How did you build it?

- I used create-react-app to build the app as it's a single page
- I used the open weather API to fetch JSON data about specific locations
- I created a function to set the state of weatherData, and used props to get
  the information to appear in my components

## How do I use it?

- Simple, just open the app, type a location in, and voila! The weather forecast
  for your requested location appears!

## Where can I find it?

- The live project is hosted [here!](http://marah-weather-app.herokuapp.com/)
